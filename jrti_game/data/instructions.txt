    THE INSTRUCTIONS

    Win the game by ...? XXX

    Use the mouse to navigate:
    - Right button grabs things to reveal instructions underneath.
    - The wheel zooms. (You can also zoom by dragging up/down with Shift.)
    - Drag with the left button (or with Ctrl) to move around the screen.

    Press keys on your keyboard to play.

    Reveal instructions and hints to figure out what keys to press.
    If this is your first time here, try what's under “I”.

    Good luck!

    Some instructions are short, some long.
    Some are helpful, some… Not so much.
    Some are behind letters, some are behind objects, some are behind creatures or special areas of the game.

    If you have lots of free time, you can try to read all the instructions – or you can only pick the ones behind interesting-looking things.
