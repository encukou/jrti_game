    THE INSTRUCTIONS

    Win the game by unlocking the wall that is keeping you trapped.

    Use the mouse to navigate:
    - Right button grabs things to reveal instructions underneath.
    - The wheel zooms. (You can also zoom by dragging up/down with Shift.)
    - Drag with the left button (or with Ctrl) to move around the screen.

    Press keys on your keyboard to play.

    Reveal instructions and hints to figure out what keys to press.
    If this is your first time here, try what's under “I”.

    Good luck!

    Most importantly, don't give up!
    You can do it!

    Make sure you keep moving! Preferably, up and to the right.

    The goal is near! Don't stop now!

    Are you sure you are not leaving anything out?

    Double-check!

    If you find instructions that are not helpful, don't despair!

    You're not likely to run out of instructions to read.

    UNLOCKING

    The master lock may be unlocked with a device bearing a one-time password.

    Make sure to configure the device properly, to avoid damage to the locking mechanism.

# A

    [XXX] MOVING LEFT

    Move your tool left by holding {A}.

    (That would be your left; not necessarily the tool's.)

# B

    [XXX] BUGS

    Bugs are various wriggly organisms that frequently appear in all kinds of virtual environments.
    Some humans specialize in exterminating them; others expend significant effort to reproduce them.

    Examination of a bug can reveal useful information about the structure and operation of its environment.

    The best time to catch a bug is when it is feeding.
    As feeding spots are some of their favorite places, bugs tend to scurry towards food when disturbed.

    [XXX] MOVING RIGHT

    This only moves the tool to the right. Figuring out the right tool to use, and the right way to use it, is up to you.

    [XXX] GRABBY TOOL

    The Grabby Tool can be selected by Shift+{G}.

    When it's selected, you can grab and release things with the {G} key.
    The grabbed object will move with the tool.

    Moving things may scare creatures hiding underneath them.

    INSTRUCTION INSTRUCTIONS

    Some instructions are short, some long.
    Some are helpful, some… Not so much.
    Some are explicit, others merely hints.
    They're behind everything: behind letters, creatures, objects, walls – everything.

    If you have lots of free time, you can try to read all the instructions – or you can only pick the ones behind interesting-looking things.
